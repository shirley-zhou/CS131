There should be no deficiencies.

I followed the spec on all functions to the best of my understanding,
despite some ambiguity in interpretation of the spec.
For many of the functions, I interpreted the prefix portion of the listdiff as the key portion to preserve.
Sometimes, suffixes are not preserved. For example, in the append-ld function, the spec only requires appending
the actual elements represented by the listdiff, ie the prefix. So the new listdiff that it outputs does
append all the prefixes of the input listdiffs as required, but the suffixes are not preserved. It simply outputs a new listdiff with the correctly appended prefix values but an arbitrary suffix for simplicity.
Same for other functions, where piazza indicated that suffixes were unimportant.

Also, expr-returning is implemented with a macro, because a normal function would not be able to retrieve the
name of the listdiff variable passed in. Being able to replace the "listdiff" with a list name such as d1 etc.
was key in implementing expr-returning given the constraints. The spec did not forbid macros, so I assume this
the correct way to implement, and it was the only way I could think of to get around the spec constraints. Macros are good for substituting portions of code.
